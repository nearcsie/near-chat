# Project Directory Orientation for AI Agents

<!-- Generated: 2026-06-14 | Updated: 2026-06-14 -->

## Purpose
This is a real-time group chat application built as a database course project. It is structured as a monorepo containing a Next.js/React frontend, a Node.js/Express backend API utilizing raw PostgreSQL queries, and a PostgreSQL 18 database, orchestrated locally via Docker Compose.

## Key Files for Project Orientation

| File | Description |
|------|-------------|
| [docker-compose.yml](docker-compose.yml) | Defines the local three-service development stack: `db` (PostgreSQL 18), `backend` (Express), and `frontend` (Next.js) |
| [docker-compose.prod.yml](docker-compose.prod.yml) | Defines the local three-service production stack with optimized builds and Cloudflare Tunnel |
| [.env.example](.env.example) | Template for environment variables. Must be copied to `.env` in the root folder before local runs |
| [issues.json](issues.json) | **CRITICAL TASK LIST**: Contains the active catalog of outstanding issues, bugs, refactorings, and features to implement with detailed tasks and acceptance criteria |

## Documentation Roadmap

To get details on database schemas, REST APIs, or local setups, refer to the following files in the `docs/` directory:

## AI Agent Guidelines

### 1. Database Operations & Schema Integrity
- Prisma has been **completely removed**. The database is accessed via raw SQL.
- When modifying schemas, do not run arbitrary SQL manually on the DB. You must write migrations under [backend/migrations/](backend/migrations/) using `node-pg-migrate`.
- Refer to [docs/database-design.md](docs/database-design.md) for actual column structures, default values, and foreign keys.

### 2. API Contract Verification
- When modifying controllers, routes, or Socket.IO handlers, you must align precisely with the types and payload schemas described in [docs/api-documentation.md](file:///home/blade520/dev/projects/1142-ntnu-db-app/docs/api-documentation.md).
- Any discrepancy will break the frontend client integration.

### 3. Local Development Workflows
- Docker Compose handles container orchestration. Root `.env` values are automatically injected.
- The `db` service must start before `backend`. Run `docker compose up -d` from the root folder.
- Run database seeding via `docker compose exec backend pnpm run db:seed`. This wipes the database and creates reproducible testing profiles (such as `alice@test.com`, password: `password123`).
- For production deployment testing:
  - Run `docker compose -f docker-compose.prod.yml up -d`.
- For more setup troubleshooting, refer to [docs/DEVELOPMENT.md](docs/DEVELOPMENT.md).

### 4. Git Workflows
- The active branch is `dev`.
- Code changes should be verified with TypeScript compiler checks (`pnpm exec tsc --noEmit` on both backend and frontend) and E2E/integration tests.
