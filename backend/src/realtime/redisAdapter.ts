 * dev stacks — land in one Socket.IO cluster on the bare channel. Their server

 * a legitimate peer's, and `backend/src/models/seed.ts` hands every seeded
 * deployment the *same* user and room ids, which is exactly when a room name
 * from one environment addresses real sockets in another.
 *
 * `REALTIME_CLUSTER_ID` is what separates them. It is left unset by default so
 * the channel stays the `near-chat-ws` this contract names, which is the right
 * default for the documented deployment — one stack, its own `redis` service —

/**
 * Cross-instance realtime fan-out, as a Socket.IO cluster adapter.
 *
 * Every `io.to(...).emit(...)`, `socketsJoin`, `socketsLeave` and
 * `disconnectSockets` in this codebase already routes through the namespace
 * adapter; the in-memory default simply stops at the process boundary. This
 * subclass carries those same operations to the other instances, so nothing
 * above it — `realtime/publisher.ts`, the services, `socketServer.ts` — has to
 * know that more than one instance exists.
 *
 * The frame on the wire is Socket.IO's own `ClusterMessage`, JSON encoded.
 * Reusing it rather than inventing an envelope is deliberate: it already
 * carries the event, the target rooms, the excluded sockets, the payload and
 * the originating server id, and a second format would be a payload contract
 * to keep in step with Socket.IO's forever.
 *
 * Delivery is at most once, and deliberately so. Redis pub/sub keeps no
 * backlog: a frame published while an instance's subscriber is down is gone,
 * and `RedisManager` replays the *subscription* on reconnect, not the frames
 * missed while it was away. That is the same guarantee the official Redis
 * adapter gives, and the reason clients recover through their Sync Cursor
 * rather than by trusting the socket.
 *
 * Two consequences that a Sync Cursor cannot repair, because they are not
 * missed events but wrong local state, and that must be closed before a
 * replica count above one becomes a supported deployment:
 *
 * - A `SOCKETS_LEAVE` lost to an outage leaves a revoked member's socket in
 *   `room_<id>` on that instance, still receiving what the room publishes
 *   afterwards. `socketServer.ts` closes this on the *subscriber* side (#649):
 *   `RedisManager` reports its subscriber coming back, and every local socket's
 *   rooms are re-derived from durable membership, leaving the ones no longer
 *   permitted. Two residual gaps are deliberately left open rather than swept
 *   for, because a periodic scan would cost a membership query per connected
 *   user forever to cover a window neither of them widens:
 *
 *   - The publisher side. `ClusterAdapter#delSockets` publishes inside a
 *     `try`/`catch` that drops the failure into a debug log and calls
 *     `super.delSockets` anyway, so `removeUserFromRoom` resolves successfully
 *     even when Redis refused the publish — and the instance holding the stale
 *     socket never lost its subscriber, so nothing there is signalled.
 *   - A drop the client recovers silently. Bun's `autoReconnect` can restore a
 *     connection without re-announcing it, and the watchdog then sees a live
 *     socket with all its listeners attached and reports nothing.
 *
 *   A lost `SOCKETS_JOIN` is not in this list: it costs live push for that
 *   room until the socket reconnects and re-derives its subscriptions, while
 *   the durable content still arrives through the client's Sync Cursor. That
 *   is a missed event, which the at-most-once bargain above already covers —
 *   not access to content the member no longer has.
 * - Typing claims are aggregated per process in `socketServer.ts`, so with the
 *   same user typing from two instances the last local claim to end retracts
 *   the indication for everyone. That is #474's remaining acceptance
 *   criterion, which this adapter unblocks rather than resolves.
 *
 * A Redis outage degrades rather than fails: `ClusterAdapter#broadcast`
 * publishes inside a `try`/`catch` and calls `super.broadcast` regardless, so
 * local delivery is unaffected and the process never sees a rejection.
